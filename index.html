              However long our Life seems to be, it has an elusive Limit. For
              short-term projects, we understand that deadlines are essential to
              beat procrastination but what about something long-term as our
              Life?
            </p>
            <p>
              We tend to overlook its ultimate deadline - Death because it's
              difficult to keep track of such a long period.

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        This web app is based on Tim Urban's blog post "Your Life in Weeks" at
        WaitButWhy. I first encountered this idea in his outstanding TED talk -
        "Inside the mind of a master procrastinator" where he explains how a
        procrastinator's system functions in terms of three comic characters. If
        you haven't seen it yet, I'd highly recommend you to watch this
        creatively
        humorous masterpiece!
      </p>
      <!-- <iframe width="560" height="315"

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
      <p>
        At the end of this talk, he highlights how procrastination makes people
        suffer and left them feeling frustrated in non-deadline situations like
        Life because there is nothing to create a panic that is necessary to get
        things done! This is where he introduces this concept of the life
        calendar
        to remind us of the limited number of week boxes that we have in our
        lives. I loved this idea so much that I have to create a web app that
        can
        allow me (and of course you) to incorporate this sense of deadline in
        our
        lives. ðŸ˜€

      <h2>FAQs (for the curious!)</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>
          How does this app extend the capabilities of the life calendar at
          WaitButWhy?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The life grid (or calendar) here makes your week boxes relatable
            to
            the Gregorian calendar by mapping them to the actual date range,
            while
            also accounting for the fact that a year does not have exactly 52
            weeks (more on this in the following question).</li>
          <li>It additionally allows you to see the percent of life spent and
            weeks used until now at the end of each week - thanks to the
            interactivity. </li>
          <li>You can make the generated life grid actionable by integrating it
            with the calendar app you use. This will enable you to reflect on
            what
            is important to you that you're procrastinating in your life, as Tim
            Urban suggests.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Why does the life grid in this app has an extra box (53rd week) for
          some
          of the years?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A normal year has 52 weeks and 1 day, whereas a leap year has 52 weeks
          and 2 days. Since weeks don't completely fit in a year, the remaining
          days accumulate together in 5 or 6 years to form an extra week. This
          way, app logic makes sure that your birthdays always fall in the 1st
          week of your age year. Otherwise, they would have shifted to the right
          end of the grid, breaking the symmetry of week-to-age mapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think about it, this is same as how the concept of leap year
          works. Since the earth completes a revolution in 365 and 1/4th day, an
          extra day gets accumulated every 4 years making it a leap year. This
          way, the new year always begins from 1st January otherwise, it would
          have shifted to subsequent dates.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>
          Why don't weeks in your generated life grid start on Monday (or
          Sunday)?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you were not born on Monday (or Sunday), this might be bothering
          you.
          It is because the years here are your age years, not our usual
          calendar
          years. So the 1st week of your life starts on the day you were born
          and
          the following weeks continue the same 7-day cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might still be unsatisfied because you want the starting date of
          the
          week boxes to sync up with that of the weeks in the calendar app where
          you are adding this. Don't worry, we can achieve this sync by assuming
          that the first week of your life starts on Monday (or Sunday) even
          though you were born on a later day in that week. Leave a thumbs up on
          this open issue to let me know that I should implement this
          functionality in the next version of this app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What is the calendar file above and how to use it after downloading?
        </h3>
        <p>
          This file is an iCalendar file (.ics) that is a standard calendar
          format
          used to transfer calendar data on the internet. Thus it can be
          imported
          easily in any calendar app you use. It consists of all-day events for
          the starting date of each week box, along with corresponding stats in
          the event description to remind you of the limit of your life.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Following are the instructions to import it in Google Calendar. For
          other calendar apps, the steps would still be the same except for the
          specifics which you can easily find on the internet.

            <h4>
              Create a new Calendar
            </h4>
            <p>
              Go to <em>Settings</em> > <em>Add calendar</em> > <em>Create new
                calendar</em>. Give it a suitable name like "Limit of Life", and
              click on <em>Create calendar</em> button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Importing events from this file in a "new" calendar is highly
              recommended because it will allow you to control notifications
              settings of all events together and will prevent the risk of
              messing up your default calendar.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              Configure notification settings

            <p>
              Under <em>Settings for my calendars</em> section, select the
              calendar we just created - "Limit of Life". Scroll down to
              <em>All-day event notifications</em> and add notifications for the
              time of day when you can sit for a while to reflect on how you've
              used your past week and how you want to use the upcoming one.
              Besides, you can also check stats like how much life you have
              spent within the event description.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, these notifs look like this (emails are hard to miss ðŸ˜…):
            </p>
            <img src="images/gcal-notif-settings.png">

            </h4>
            <p>
              Within settings, go to <em>Import & export</em> > <em>Import</em>.
              Upload the iCal file you've downloaded, and make sure to select
              the new calendar we created (named "Limit of Life") in <em>Add to
                Calendar</em> dropdown. Click on <em>Import</em> button and wait
              for at least 1 min - events spanned throughout your remaining
              lifetime are being added!
            </p>
            <p>
              You may see "Oops! we couldn't import this file, try again in a
              few minutes". Don't worry, this a potential bug I observed in
              Google Calendar when importing large files. Go back to your
              calendar, you should be able to see the events, if the "Limit of
              Life" calendar is checked in the sidebar.
            </p>

            <h4>
              [Optional] Verify the completion of import
            </h4>
            <p>
              Observe the starting date of the last week of your life in the
              grid and open it in your calendar. You can do this quickly by
              appending <em>/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;date&gt;</em> for
              that date, to the URL in the address bar. In the open week or
              month, you should see a "Limit of Life" event scheduled.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>
          Why this hassle?
        </h4>
        <p>
          You might be wondering why isn't there any automatic way to import
          these events. There is one but for that, you'd need to authenticate
          this app to access your calendar. So respecting your privacy concerns
