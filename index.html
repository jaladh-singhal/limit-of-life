              However long our Life seems to be, it has an elusive Limit. For
              short-term projects, we understand that deadlines are essential to
              beat procrastination but what about something long-term as our
              Life?
            </p>
            <p>
              We tend to overlook its ultimate deadline - Death because it's
              difficult to keep track of such a long period.

        <p>
          This web app is based on Tim Urban's blog post "Your Life in Weeks" at
          WaitButWhy. I first encountered this idea in his outstanding TED talk
          -
          "Inside the mind of a master procrastinator" where he explains how a
          procrastinator's system functions in terms of three comic characters.
          If
          you haven't seen it yet, I'd highly recommend you to watch this
          creatively
          humorous masterpiece!
        </p>
        <iframe class="inspiration__yt-embed"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU" frameborder="0"
          allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          At the end of this talk, he highlights how procrastination makes
          people
          suffer and left them feeling frustrated in non-deadline situations
          like
          Life because there is nothing to create a panic that is necessary to
          get
          things done! This is where he introduces this concept of the life
          calendar
          to remind us of the limited number of week boxes that we have in our
          lives. I loved this idea so much that I have to create a web app that
          can
          allow me (and of course you) to incorporate this sense of deadline in
          our
          lives. 😀

                  while
                  also accounting for the fact that a year does not have exactly
                  52
                  weeks (more on this in the following question).</li>
                <li>It additionally allows you to see the percent of life spent

              Why does the life grid shown above has 53 weeks for
              some
              of the years?
              <i class="fas fa-plus js-accordion__state-icon"></i>

              <p>
                A normal year has 52 weeks and 1 day, whereas a leap year has 52
                weeks
                and 2 days. Since weeks don't completely fit in a year, the
                remaining
                days accumulate together in 5 or 6 years to form an extra week.
                This
                way, app logic makes sure that your birthdays always fall in the
                1st
                week of your age year. Otherwise, they would have shifted to the
                right
                end of the grid, breaking the symmetry of week-to-age mapping.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you think about it, this is same as how the concept of leap
                year
                works. Since the earth completes a revolution in 365 and 1/4th
                day,
                an
                extra day gets accumulated every 4 years making it a leap year.
                This
                way, the new year always begins from 1st January otherwise, it
                would
                have shifted to subsequent dates.

                It is because the years here are your age years, not our usual
                calendar
                years. So the 1st week of your life starts on the day you were
                born
                and
                the following weeks continue the same 7-day cycle.

                date
                of
                the
                week boxes to sync up with that of the weeks in the calendar app
                where
                you are adding this. Don't worry, we can achieve this sync by
                assuming
                that the first week of your life starts on Monday (or Sunday)
                even
                though you were born on a later day in that week. Leave a thumbs
                up
                on
                this open issue to let me know that I should implement this
                functionality in the next version of this app.

                This file is an iCalendar file (.ics) that is a standard
                calendar
                format
                used to transfer calendar data on the internet. Thus it can be
                imported
                easily in any calendar app you use. It consists of all-day
                events
                for
                the starting date of each week box, along with corresponding
                stats
                in
                the event description to remind you of the limit of your life.

                Following are the instructions to import it in Google Calendar.
                For
                other calendar apps, the steps would still be the same except
                for

                details which you can easily find on the internet.

                    Importing events from this file in a "new" calendar is
                    highly
                    recommended because it will allow you to control
                    notifications
                    settings of all events together and will prevent the risk of
                    messing up your default calendar.

                    for
                    the
                    time of day when you can sit for a while to reflect on how
                    you've
                    used your past week and how you want to use the upcoming
                    one.
                    Besides, you can also check stats like how much life you
                    have
                    spent within the event description.

                    for at least 1 min - events spanned throughout your

                    lifetime are being added!

                    You may see "Oops! we couldn't import this file, try again

                    in
                    Google Calendar when importing large files. Go back to your
                    calendar, you should be able to see the events, if the
                    "Limit
                    of
                    Life" calendar is checked in the sidebar.

                    Observe the starting date of the last week of your life in
                    the
                    grid and open it in your calendar. You can do this quickly
                    by
                    appending <em>/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;date&gt;</em>
                    for
                    that date, to the URL in the address bar. In the open week
                    or
                    month, you should see a "Limit of Life" event scheduled.

              <h4>
                Why this hassle?
              </h4>
              <p>
                You might be wondering why isn't there any automatic way to
                import
                these events. There is one but for that, you'd need to
                authenticate
                this app to access your calendar. So respecting your privacy
                concerns
                & trust issues, I didn't build that feature. But if you still
                want
                it,
                give a thumbs up on this open issue, or if you know a better way
                for
                adding bulk events, let me know by putting a comment there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until then, you have to do the importing manually - don't
                procrastinate, it only takes < 5 min! 😜 </p>
